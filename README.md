## Mariko's Website

## This is my first website/Github Page. 

I'm using this site to learn about... 
- Github and Git
- HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Hopefully, this site will function as an active resume and portfolio of my work. Check it out! 

## Photon by HTML5 UP Theme
This site was produced using the [Photon Theme](https://html5up.net/photon). Modifications were done via simple HTML/CSS changes.
