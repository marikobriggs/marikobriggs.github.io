## Mariko's Website

## This is my first website/Github Page. 

I'm using this site to learn about... 
- Github and Git
- HTML, CSS, and Markdown

Hopefully, this site will function as an active resume and portfolio of my work. Check it out! 

## Cayman Theme 
This site was produced using the [Cayman Theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman) for Github Pages. Modifications were done via simple HTML/CSS changes.
