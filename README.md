## Nice to meet you! 

I am a computer science student at the University of Washington, Tacoma. 

## My Goals

I'm using this site to learn about... 
- Github and Git
- HTML, CSS, and Markdown

Hopefully, this site will function as an active resume and portfolio of my work. Check it out! 

### Main Links

Check out some of my work on [Github](https://github.com/marikobriggs) and [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/mkbriggs?nav_source=navbar).
